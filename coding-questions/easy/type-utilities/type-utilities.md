<h1>
Type Utilities
</h1>

Implementing these utility functions won't be an entire interview question itself, but you likely need to implement some of these utility functions as part of solving more complex interview questions.<br><br>

Most of the functions involve only one line and you might not even need to write a separate function for a single line of logic. The more important thing here is to know how to check for each data type.<br><br>

It's also important to note the difference between <strong>null</strong> and <strong>undefined</strong>. null == undefined is true, so we need to use === if the intention is to checking for exact null and undefined values.
